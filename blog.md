Welcome to my blog, where I share things that I believe deserves to be on the internet but not cutout for The Revelations, random things I am interested in, and some documentation/journalling on the majors things that happened to me.

Check out my twice a month newsletter [The Revelations](https://revelations.theluqmn.com) if you are interested in becoming an aspiring entrepreneur, leader, or is simply interested in the world. Each issue exposes you, the reader, to topics that I find essential to develop a comprehensive worldview.
