description: My journey building TradeCLI for TerminalCraft and winning a Raspberry Pi 4.

Recently, I participated in [TerminalCraft](https://hackclub.com/terminalcraft/) by Hack Club, where I built **TradeCLI**â€”a command-line trading companion designed to make managing trades simple, fast, and fun, all powered by live market data from Alpha Vantage.

## What is TradeCLI?

TradeCLI is a Python-based CLI app that lets you track, analyze, and manage trades right from your terminal. It fetches real-time prices, charts, and market data using Alpha Vantage, with no API key setup needed for basic features. The goal: make trading accessible and enjoyable for everyone, especially beginners.

## Features

- **Beginner-Friendly:** Intuitive commands youâ€™ll remember in seconds.
- **Fast & Lightweight:** No bloat, just the essentials.
- **Cheerful UX:** Friendly prompts and positive feedback.
- **Visuals:** Generate simple charts for quick price insights.
- **Portfolio Overview:** Track your positions and performance.
- **Favourites:** Mark tickers you love for quick access.
- **Market Screener:** Find opportunities at a glance.
- **Live Market Data:** All prices and charts are real, not simulated.
- **Gainers/Losers:** See top movers in your session.
- **Last Trade Time:** Track how fresh your data is.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Prevents crashes with invalid ticker data.
- **Bug-Free Analytics:** Reliable analytics, gainers, and screener commands.
- **Hack Club AI Integration:** Ask questions or get help from AI right in your terminal.
